## Installing [`packages`](./packages)

This repository contains my personal configurations for essential tools i use daily. 
I prefer minimal configurations focused on speed and low resource usage. 
constantly evolving as I discover more efficient or elegant ways to interact with my system so it's never finished.

I mostly use Fedora, configurations will be ok but some things here may not be os or distro agnostic at all.
