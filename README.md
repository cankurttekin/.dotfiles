## contains my configurations for must have tools
This repository contains my personal configurations for essential tools I use daily, everything here reflects how I actually use my system.
I prefer minimal configurations focused on convenience, speed and low resource usage. 
These configs might seem plain, lacking in aesthetics or aliases, but they are intentional and functional for me. 
Constantly evolving as I discover more efficient or elegant ways to interact with my system so it's never finished.

### My popular tools currently:
- sway – go to tiling window manager for wayland
- tmux – terminal multiplexer
- neovim – main text editor
- wofi – wayland application launcher
- foot – lightweight terminal emulator
- fzf – fuzzy finder for fast navigation
- tlp – power management for laptops

## package installer script
- will install packages inside [`packages`](./packages):

## branch i3
- contains basic i3 configuration for my x11 work machine
